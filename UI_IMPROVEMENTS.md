# UI Quality Improvements Tracking

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation of UI/UX improvements for the Putty golf app to enhance user experience and visual quality.

## Issues to Fix

### 1. ✅ Default Settings on App Load
**Issue**: App loads with no slope and 10ft distance by default
**Solution**: Set more interesting/realistic default values
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Changes**:
- [x] Set default slope values to show some break (2 uphill, -3 left)
- [x] Set default distance to a more challenging value (12ft hole, 15ft power)
- [x] Apply to both putting and swing modes

### 2. ✅ Club Selection UI Enhancement
**Issue**: Currently requires clicking down arrow repeatedly to select clubs
**Solution**: Implement bottom-up modal with all club options
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Changes**:
- [x] Create modal component for club selection
- [x] Show all clubs in a grid/list
- [x] Add "Putter" option that switches to putting mode
- [x] Replace current dropdown with modal trigger

### 3. ✅ Swing Mode Quick Controls
**Issue**: Quick controls only show Power/Face Angle/Club
**Solution**: Add all swing parameters to quick controls
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Changes**:
- [x] Attack Angle control moved to primary section
- [x] Club Path control moved to primary section
- [x] Strike Quality control moved to primary section
- [x] All controls now immediately accessible

### 4. ✅ Last Shot Summary UI Fix
**Issue**: Missing "remaining" label and z-index conflict with settings menu
**Solution**: Add label and fix layering
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Changes**:
- [x] Add "remaining" label next to distance metric
- [x] Fix z-index so settings menu appears above summary
- [x] Hide summary when settings menu is open

### 5. ✅ Add SW-Chipping Club
**Issue**: Need specialized club for short chips (10-50 yards)
**Solution**: Add new club with appropriate physics
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Changes**:
- [x] Add SW-Chip to club data constants
- [x] Configure physics for 10-50 yard range (30yd typical)
- [x] Set appropriate launch angles and spin rates
- [x] Lower club speed and smash factor for controlled chips

### 6. ✅ Swing Challenge Scenery Update
**Issue**: Current scenery doesn't look like proper par 3/4 holes
**Solution**: Create simple fairway view with distant hole
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Changes**:
- [x] Created separate fairway texture for swing challenges
- [x] Added darker, more natural fairway color
- [x] Increased green/fairway size for swing mode
- [x] Different texture patterns for fairway vs green

## Implementation Order
1. Default settings (quick fix)
2. Last shot summary fixes (UI polish)
3. Club selection modal (major UX improvement)
4. Add SW-Chipping club (new feature)
5. Swing mode quick controls (UI enhancement)
6. Scenery updates (visual improvement)

## Testing Checklist
